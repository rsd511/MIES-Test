# ML Model  
## Process :-  
- Data cleaning & handling imbalance process was done in the **Data Analysis.ipynb** file  
- Various models were tested with the following results:  
--	Logistic Regression showed good accuracy & good prediction balance  
-- KNN showed good accuracy & bad prediction balance   
-- Naive Bayes showed low accuracy & good prediction balance  
-- XGBoost showed low accuracy & low prediction balance  
-- Random Forests showed better accuracy & good prediction balance  
-- SVM showed high accuracy & high prediction balance  
-- SVM was selected as the final model
